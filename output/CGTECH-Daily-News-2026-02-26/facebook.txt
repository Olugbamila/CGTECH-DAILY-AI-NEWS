Have you ever wondered how AI can help improve patient safety in healthcare? A new study compared human and machine-assisted analysis for Big Qualitative Data Analysis and found that together, they can identify targeted interventions to enhance patient safety. The study used a large UK-wide survey on peri-operative cardiac arrest and found that machine-assisted analysis can significantly reduce analysis time. However, human input is still necessary for expertise and nuance. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we analyze large qualitative datasets in healthcare research.
