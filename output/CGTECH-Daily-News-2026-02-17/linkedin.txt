POST (PERSONAL INSIGHT):
As a professional in the tech industry, I'm intrigued by the use of artificial intelligence in storm preparation. Pacific Gas & Electric's utilization of AI-enhanced weather models to determine where to send crews and equipment is a great example of how technology can be leveraged to improve disaster management. This approach not only helps to reduce the risk of power outages but also ensures a more efficient response to the storm. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the role of AI in disaster management. Let's connect and discuss how technology can be used to build more resilient communities. Follow me for more insights on the intersection of technology and society.

POST (PERSONAL INSIGHT):
As we continue to see the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in various industries, it's exciting to note that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) is set to introduce the Eligible Manufacturer-Importer scheme by March 1. This new system has the potential to significantly reduce physical inspections and human intervention, enabling faster and more data-driven decision-making. I believe this move will not only increase efficiency but also reduce delays in the customs clearance process. Let's keep an eye on how this development unfolds and its potential impact on trade and commerce. #AI #TechNews #CustomsClearance
