POST (PERSONAL INSIGHT):
As I reflect on the current state of the job market and the impact of artificial intelligence, I'm reminded of the 'lump of labour fallacy' concept. While it's true that AI has led to significant job losses in certain sectors, it's also important to recognize the potential for new technologies to create new opportunities. As leaders, it's our responsibility to navigate this complex landscape and find ways to mitigate the negative consequences of AI while embracing its benefits. Let's work together to create a future where technology enhances human capabilities, rather than replacing them. #AI #TechNews #FutureOfWork
