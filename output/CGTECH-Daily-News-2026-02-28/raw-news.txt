SUMMARY:
A recent study compared human vs. machine-assisted analysis for Big Qualitative Data Analysis in public health, using AI tools to analyze a large national survey on peri-operative cardiac arrest. The results showed that machine-assisted analysis significantly reduced analysis time, but required human input for topic expertise and nuance. The study found that AI can help inform targeted interventions and quality improvement initiatives to enhance patient safety. The approach presents a new method for analyzing large qualitative datasets in healthcare research. The use of AI in health research has grown over recent years, and this study contributes to the development of novel techniques for Big Qualitative Data Analysis.
