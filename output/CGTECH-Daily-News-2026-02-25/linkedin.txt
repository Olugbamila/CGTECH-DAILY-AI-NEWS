POST (PERSONAL INSIGHT):
I'm excited to share a story of innovation and progress in the manufacturing sector. CEAT Tyres' Chennai factory is a great example of how machine learning, sensors, and computer vision can come together to drive efficiency and reduce waste. What's even more impressive is the positive impact this has had on hiring women, with 30% of the workforce now female. As we continue to navigate the intersection of technology and industry, it's essential to consider the broader social implications of our innovations. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible. #AI #TechNews #Innovation

POST (PERSONAL INSIGHT):
As I reflect on the current state of the job market and the impact of artificial intelligence, I'm reminded of the 'lump of labour fallacy' concept. While it's true that AI has led to significant changes in various sectors, resulting in job losses, I believe that with the right policy measures, we can ensure that the benefits of AI are shared by all. It's time for policymakers to take bold action and implement a 'policy bazooka' to mitigate the negative effects of AI on employment. Let's work together to create a future where AI augments human capabilities, rather than replacing them. #AI #TechNews #FutureOfWork
